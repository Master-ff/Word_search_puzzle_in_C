# Word Search Puzzle Solver

This project reads a word search puzzle and a list of words from a text file, then finds the words in various directions within the puzzle. It supports input via a file and displays the found words along with their positions and directions. This is implemented in C and can be compiled and run from the command line.

To get started, run `make` and then execute the binary with your puzzle file present.
